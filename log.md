# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100-days-of-code repo and personalized it. Made another repo for my projects. Also made an account on twitter, instagram and wordpress for this project.

**Thoughts:** I'll use [Jennifer Dewalt's projects](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) for inspiration. But for my main project, I will make my own portfolio website.
