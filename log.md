# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Forked the 100-days-of-code repo and personalized it. Made another repo for my projects. Also made an account on twitter, instagram and wordpress for this project.

**Thoughts:** I'll use [Jennifer Dewalt's projects](https://jenniferdewalt.com/) for inspiration. But for my main project, I will make my own portfolio website.

### Day 1: June 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made a personal portfolio website from a bootstrap template. Uploaded it on Github and turned it into gh-pages. Learned how to edit and compile less file to css. Finished HTML5 and CSS at FCC.

**Thoughts:** Someday I'll make my own portfolio website without using a template.
